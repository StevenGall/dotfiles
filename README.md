# 🛠️ Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repo — the configuration files that help power my development environment. These files are tailored to my workflow and preferences, covering shell, editor, terminal, and other dev tools. Do not blindly copy my configurations without careful inspection. Because something works for me DOES NOT mean it works for you.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Minimal, reproducible, and pragmatic. These dotfiles are meant to:
- Provide consistency across machines
- Be easily bootstrapped on a new environment
- Stay as close to defaults as practical
- Prioritize performance and developer ergonomics

🙋‍♂️ About

Maintained by @StevenGall. Built for fast onboarding and environment reproducibility. I hate having to set up new machines and this is the most pragmatic way to ensure I have everything I need to be productive.
